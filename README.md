# ITC-Hotel-revenue-optimization-using-power-bi
Developed an interactive, multi-page Power BI dashboard to analyze ITC Hotels’ sales data across multiple cities and properties, focusing on financial performance, customer booking behavior, occupancy trends, room category performance, and cancellations.
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the revenue performance of ITC Hotels, one of India’s leading luxury hospitality chains. Using Power BI dashboards, the analysis provides stakeholders with actionable insights into financial performance, occupancy rates, booking behavior, and cancellation trends across multiple properties and room categories.

Key insights include:

Revenue Analysis – Total revenue of ₹2 billion with strong contributions from Elite, Premium, and Presidential room categories; Mumbai and Bengaluru as top revenue-generating cities.

Occupancy Insights – An overall occupancy rate of 43.5%, with significantly higher weekend stays compared to weekdays.

Room Category Performance – Elite rooms emerged as the top-performing category; majority of revenue comes from short stays (1–2 nights) and last-minute bookings (0–2 days before check-in).

Cancellation Analysis – High overall cancellation rate (24.83%) leading to ₹199 million in lost revenue, with same-day and next-day cancellations being the most critical contributors.

The project highlights opportunities for ITC Hotels to:

Boost weekday occupancy through targeted promotions.

Implement better cancellation policies to reduce last-minute revenue loss.

Optimize pricing and upselling strategies for high-demand room categories.

Refine property-level strategies based on city and property-specific performance.
